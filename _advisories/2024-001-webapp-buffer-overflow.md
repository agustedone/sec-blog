## Advisory Information

- **Advisory ID**: SECBLOG-2024-001
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-0001
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)
- **Discovery Date**: January 10, 2024
- **Disclosure Date**: January 15, 2024
- **Vendor**: WebApp Corp
- **Product**: WebApp Enterprise
- **Affected Versions**: 2.1.0 through 2.3.5
- **Fixed Version**: 2.4.0

## Summary

A critical buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the authentication module of WebApp Enterprise that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

## Technical Details

The vulnerability exists in the `process_user_input()` function located in `/src/auth/login.c`. The function fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied input before copying it to a fixed-size buffer using the unsafe `strcpy()` function.

### Vulnerable Code Path

```c
// File: /src/auth/login.c
// Function: process_user_input()
char username_buffer[256];
strcpy(username_buffer, user_input); // Vulnerable line
```

### Attack Vector

An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/login` endpoint with a username parameter exceeding 256 characters, causing a stack-based buffer overflow.

## Proof of Concept

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 500

username=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[shellcode]&password=test
```

## Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:

1. Execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process
2. Potentially escalate privileges to system-level access
3. Install malware or backdoors on the affected system
4. Access sensitive data stored on the server
5. Use the compromised system as a pivot point for lateral movement

## Affected Systems

All installations of WebApp Enterprise versions 2.1.0 through 2.3.5 are vulnerable. The following configurations are particularly at risk:

- Systems exposed to the internet
- Installations with default configurations
- Systems without proper input validation middleware

## Remediation

### Immediate Actions

1. **Upgrade immediately** to WebApp Enterprise version 2.4.0 or later
2. **Apply web application firewall (WAF) rules** to block requests with oversized username parameters
3. **Monitor logs** for potential exploitation attempts

### Temporary Workaround

If immediate patching is not possible, implement the following workaround:

```nginx
# Nginx configuration to limit request size
location /login {
    client_max_body_size 1k;
    # Additional security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
}
```

### Code Fix

The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.4.0 by replacing `strcpy()` with `strncpy()` and adding proper bounds checking:

```c
// Fixed code in version 2.4.0
char username_buffer[256];
if (strlen(user_input) >= sizeof(username_buffer)) {
    log_error("Username too long");
    return AUTH_ERROR;
}
strncpy(username_buffer, user_input, sizeof(username_buffer) - 1);
username_buffer[sizeof(username_buffer) - 1] = '\0';
```

## Detection

System administrators can detect potential exploitation attempts by monitoring for:

- HTTP requests to /login with unusually large POST bodies
- Process crashes of the web server application
- Unusual network connections from the web server process
- System calls indicative of privilege escalation

### YARA Rule

```yara
rule WebApp_Exploit_Detection {
    meta:
        description = "Detects WebApp buffer overflow exploit attempts"
        author = "SecBlog Research Team"
        date = "2024-01-15"
        
    strings:
        $login_path = "/login" ascii
        $long_username = /username=[A-Za-z0-9+\/=]{300,}/ ascii
        
    condition:
        $login_path and $long_username
}
```
